# weather-app

This is a weather website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the `fetch` API to integrate data from the Weather API website.

## Features

- Search bar that allows users to enter a location and get the current weather conditions
- 3-day forecast

## API Integration

We used the `fetch` API to retrieve data from the Weather API. The `fetch` API is a modern way to make network requests in JavaScript. It allows us to make asynchronous requests to the server and handle the response in a more elegant way than traditional AJAX requests.

To use the Weather API, you need to sign up for an API key on the https://www.weatherapi.com/. Once you have an API key, you can use it to make requests to the Weather API and retrieve weather data for any location in the world.



## Usage

To use this website, follow these steps:

1. Enter a location in the search bar.
2. Click the search button.
3. The current weather conditions and 3-day forecast will be displayed.
